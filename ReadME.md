Sure! Here's a clean and attractive `README.md` tailored for your **FaceRecognition** GitHub repo:

# 🔍 FaceRecognition

A simple **Face Recognition** model built on PyTorch & PyTorch Lightning, fine-tuned for identifying and comparing celebrity faces via custom embeddings.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for face recognition. The model was **originally trained for celebrity face classification** and later modified to remove the classification head in favor of **embedding-based face matching**.

Using this setup, you can extract face embeddings from any input image and perform **custom face recognition** via similarity comparisons.

## 📂 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Model.py` | Has all the model codes and training pipeline from pytorch lightning |
| `Detection.py` | Contains the logic for detecting faces and preprocessing them for the model. |
| `Test.py` | Run this script to test the model on your custom image set. Supports inference and embedding comparison. |

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Celebrity face pretraining** for strong identity features.
- ✅ Embedding-based recognition – compare faces using cosine similarity.
- ✅ Clean PyTorch Lightning structure for scalability.
- ✅ Modular design for easy customization.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pytorch-lightning
```

---

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Place your images in the appropriate directory.
2. Run:

```bash
python Test.py
```

- Detect faces using `Detection.py`
- Generate embeddings
- Compare and output recognition results

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Training**: The model was trained on a **celebrity face classification dataset** using a standard CNN-based architecture.
2. **Embedding Conversion**: The final classification layer was removed, turning the model into a **feature extractor** that outputs **face embeddings**.
3. **Recognition**: By comparing embeddings using cosine similarity, the model can identify similar or matching faces.
